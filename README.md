Music streaming API implementation in NodeJS.

### How to run it ?

1) After cloning it, in CMD / terminal, go to the directory where package.json file is located and run

```javascript

npm install

```

2) After installing the node_modules, in the same directory, in CMD / terminal, run

```javascript

nodemon

```

3) This will launch the server at localhost:3000. Open it on your browser. That's it!!!

   Also, if anyone have any further improvements in mind, feel free to make a pull request.
